# RESTest experiment

This repository contains the relevant data produced when running [RESTest](https://github.com/isa-group/RESTest) against OAS DB generated OpenAPI mock API implementations.

## Overview

Each top-level directory is named after one of the OpenAPI samples generated by OAS DB. Inside each top-level directory, the following structure is to be found:

- **annotations**: contains an annotation file indicating what issues are to be found in the corresponding OpenAPI sample.
- **apis**: contains the mock API implementation generated by OAS DB (which is what RESTest runs against).
- **restest_conf**: restest.properties file used for testing the OAS DB generated API.
- **restest_logs**: logs produced by RESTest during the test.
- **restest_results**: RESTest report; the results of the test.
- **restest_tests**: the tests generated by RESTest to test the mock API implementation.
- **samples**: the OpenAPI sample generated by OAS DB.
- **sinatra_logs**: webserver logs showing which HTTP requests the running mock API received from RESTest.
